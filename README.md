# VRGP service

This repository contains the code of the service that runs the implementation
of the [VRGP specification](https://github.com/aboamare/vrgp-specifications). This is the vessel-side of the protocol that
communicates with a Maritime Operating Center (MOC; the shore-side).

For proprietary calls or boats with existing communication protocols, they need
to be translated into VRGP "language". For an example, take a look at [the Ã…boat
adapter](https://github.com/RemoteBoatX/aboat-vrgp-adapter).
